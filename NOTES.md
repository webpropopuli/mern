MERN App from Traversy
Curr at part 021,

# Changes

1. Not using Mongoose. Straight Mongo. Data is too basic to require a schema manager
2. Will probably use Mongo Validation instead of all this nonsense

# ToDo

1. Replace JWT with Google Auth
2. Use mongo native Validation instead of Validator? See https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/ and https://www.compose.com/articles/document-validation-in-mongodb-by-example/. At the moment I'm skipping the Mongoose .populate() command

# Ideas

1. Turn the first part (?) into an app starter kit. (ex. login, 1 public/1 private route, React starter page, ...)
